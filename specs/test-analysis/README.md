# Test analysis

This directory is owned by the test-analysis agent (see `.claude/skills/test-watch/SKILL.md`).

Each file under `<phase>/<feature-slug>.md` reports the agent's coverage analysis for one feature spec in `specs/plans/`. The agent regenerates these on every run when there is a new commit on `main`.

## Layout

```
specs/test-analysis/
├── README.md                       # this index
└── <phase>/
    └── <feature-slug>.md           # per-feature findings (generated)
```

## How to run the agent

In a Claude Code session at the repo root:

```
/loop 90s /test-watch
```

The first tick after the loop starts will create `.claude/worktrees/test-agent` and `.claude/test-agent/state.json`, then check whether there's new work. Most ticks are silent no-ops. When new commits land on `main`, the agent opens a PR with new tests + an updated set of findings.

## How to run the analysis once, manually

```
/test-analyze
```

writes findings to this directory without creating a branch or opening a PR. Useful for ad-hoc inspection. Pair with `/test-implement` to write the tests, then a normal `git commit` + `gh pr create` if you want to ship the analysis yourself.

## Index

Generated automatically — leave this section alone; the agent rewrites it.

<!-- AGENT-INDEX-BEGIN -->
*This section is regenerated on every `/test-analyze` tick. After the test-watch skill redesign in PR #97, the prior index — written under the old (loose) coverage rules — was intentionally cleared along with the per-feature pages. The next `/test-analyze` tick will rewrite this block with the new strict-AC-N coverage model.*
